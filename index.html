<h1>CLAUDE; The Silent Courtyard</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: The Empty Morning</h2>
The first thing I noticed when I woke up wasn't the silence—it was the quality of the silence. You know how quiet sounds different at three in the morning versus eight? This was neither. This was the kind of quiet that pressed against your eardrums like water, heavy and wrong.
I lay in bed for a moment, staring at the familiar water stain on my ceiling that looked like a distorted map of some country I'd never visit. The apartment felt exactly the same as always: cramped, with walls too thin and neighbors too loud. Except today, there were no neighbors.
My phone showed 9:47 AM on a Tuesday. I should have been hearing Mrs. Kowalski's morning routine through the wall—her kettle whistling, her television blaring the news, her heavy footsteps as she shuffled around her kitchen. Instead, nothing.
I rolled out of bed and padded to the window, my bare feet cold against the linoleum. The view was exactly as it always was: the concrete courtyard below with its neat lines of parked cars, the playground equipment that had seen better decades, and the ring of apartment buildings that boxed us all in like a concrete embrace. Everything looked normal. Everything looked exactly right.
Except it was completely, utterly empty.
I pressed my face against the glass, my breath fogging the window. The cars were there—I could see old Mr. Petrov's beat-up red Lada, the blue minivan that belonged to the family with three kids, even my own rusty white sedan parked in its usual spot. But no people. No movement. No life.
The morning light had that flat, overcast quality that made everything look washed out, like an old photograph left too long in the sun. I counted the windows across the courtyard—dozens of them, arranged in their familiar grid pattern across the Soviet-era apartment blocks. Not one showed any sign of occupancy. No lights, no shadows moving behind curtains, no faces peering out like mine.
My heart started doing that thing where it feels like it's beating too close to the surface of my chest. I told myself to stay calm. Maybe everyone had left early for work. Maybe there was some event I'd forgotten about. Maybe—
I grabbed my phone and dialed my neighbor's number. Mrs. Kowalski always answered on the second ring, usually with some complaint about the noise from the floor above or the state of the elevator. The phone rang once, twice, three times. Then a mechanical voice: "The number you have dialed is not in service."
I tried my work. Same message. I tried every number in my contact list. Same result, every time.
The panic started as a cold spot in my stomach, like I'd swallowed ice water. I threw on yesterday's clothes—jeans and a gray sweater that smelled faintly of cigarette smoke from the bar I'd been at... when was that? Last night? The night before? The memory felt fuzzy, like trying to recall a dream.
I stepped out into the hallway, and the first thing that hit me was the smell. Or rather, the absence of smell. No cooking odors, no cleaning products, no lingering trace of human habitation. The air tasted stale and empty, like it had been sitting undisturbed for years.
The hallway looked identical to how it always did—the same faded green wallpaper with its pattern of tiny flowers, the same flickering fluorescent light that cast everything in a sickly pale glow, the same worn carpet runner that had probably been there since the building was constructed. But something felt different about the proportions, like the ceiling was slightly higher or the walls slightly wider than they should be.
I knocked on Mrs. Kowalski's door first. The sound echoed strangely, as if the hallway were much longer than it actually was. No response. I knocked harder, then pounded with my fist. The door felt solid, real, but beyond it was only silence.
"Mrs. Kowalski?" I called out. My voice sounded thin and strange in the empty air. "Are you okay?"
Nothing.
I tried the door handle. Locked, as expected. But as I touched the metal, I noticed something odd—the brass nameplate beside the door was blank. Just a rectangular piece of tarnished metal with no engraving, no indication of who lived behind that door.
I looked down the hallway at the other doors. Every nameplate was blank.
The cold spot in my stomach spread outward like spilled water. I moved to the next door and knocked. Then the next. And the next. Each door was identical—the same dark wood, the same brass handle, the same empty nameplate. And behind each one, the same absolute silence.
I reached the end of the hallway and tried the elevator. The button lit up when I pressed it, and I could hear the mechanical sounds of the car moving between floors. But when the doors opened, the elevator was empty, and something about the interior looked wrong. The buttons were all there—ground floor through ninth floor—but they seemed to be arranged differently than I remembered. And there were more of them. Too many.
I counted them twice. Fourteen buttons, from B2 up to 12. But our building only had nine floors, and definitely no basement levels.
I stepped inside anyway. The elevator smelled like ozone and something else—something organic and unpleasant that I couldn't identify. I pressed the button for the ground floor, the same button I'd pressed hundreds of times before.
The elevator lurched into motion with a grinding sound that seemed louder than usual. The floor indicator above the doors counted down: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... and then it kept going. B1. B2. And then buttons I hadn't seen before lit up: B3, B4, B5.
I pressed the ground floor button again, jabbing it repeatedly. The elevator ignored me and continued its descent. The walls around me groaned and creaked, and I could swear they were getting narrower, pressing in from both sides.
Finally, mercifully, the elevator stopped. The doors opened with a cheerful ding that sounded obscenely normal.
I stepped out into what should have been the main lobby of my building. Instead, I found myself in a hallway that stretched in both directions farther than should have been physically possible. The walls were the same faded green as upstairs, but the ceiling was much higher, disappearing into shadows above. The fluorescent lights flickered in an irregular pattern, casting moving shadows that made the wallpaper pattern seem to writhe and shift.
To my left, the hallway extended into darkness. To my right, it curved away and out of sight. Both directions looked identical—the same doors, the same spacing, the same empty nameplates. I could see dozens of doors, maybe hundreds, stretching away into the distance.
I chose right, walking slowly down the endless corridor. My footsteps echoed strangely, sometimes sounding close and sharp, other times muffled and distant. The doors I passed were all identical to the ones in my building, but as I walked, I started to notice small differences. Some had scratches around the locks. Others had small dents or chips in the wood. A few had what looked like dark stains around the edges.
I stopped at one door that looked exactly like Mrs. Kowalski's and knocked. The sound seemed to be absorbed by the walls, producing only a dull thud instead of the sharp rap I expected. No response.
I tried the handle. It turned.
The door opened onto darkness so complete it seemed solid. I couldn't see anything beyond the threshold—not walls, not floor, not ceiling. Just an absence that seemed to pull at my eyes. A smell wafted out, sweet and cloying, like flowers left too long in water.
I slammed the door shut and backed away, my heart hammering against my ribs.
The hallway suddenly felt much colder. I could see my breath misting in front of my face, and the fluorescent lights seemed dimmer than before. I hurried back toward where I thought the elevator should be, but when I reached the spot, there was only more hallway. The elevator was gone.
I broke into a run, my footsteps echoing and multiplying until it sounded like a crowd of people running alongside me. The doors blurred past—dozens, hundreds, all identical except for those small, disturbing differences. Some had handles that looked newer than others. Some had scratches that formed almost-patterns. And some—some had dark stains seeping out from underneath.
I ran until my lungs burned and my legs ached, but the hallway never ended. It just curved and twisted, leading me deeper into the building that couldn't exist. Eventually, exhaustion forced me to stop. I leaned against one of the walls, gasping for breath, and realized that the wallpaper pattern was different here. Instead of flowers, it showed small geometric shapes that hurt to look at directly, as if they were moving in ways that three-dimensional objects shouldn't be able to move.
That's when I heard it—a sound that made my blood freeze in my veins. It was the sound of a door opening, somewhere behind me in the endless hallway. A soft creak of hinges, followed by footsteps.
But these weren't normal footsteps. They were too light, too quick, and they had a quality that reminded me of someone trying to walk quietly but not quite succeeding. The rhythm was wrong too—sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes with extra steps that didn't match the pattern of human walking.
I pressed myself against the wall and listened. The footsteps were getting closer, echoing through the hallway with that same strange multiplication effect that had happened with my own running. But now I could hear that it wasn't just one set of footsteps—it was many, all slightly out of sync with each other, creating a rustling, scuttling sound that made my skin crawl.
I looked back down the hallway, but I couldn't see anything moving in the flickering light. The shadows seemed deeper now, and they moved independently of the light sources, flowing along the walls like dark water.
The footsteps stopped.
The silence that followed was somehow worse than the sound had been. It was the silence of something listening, something waiting. I held my breath and tried to make myself as small as possible against the wall.
Then I heard a new sound—the soft scraping of fingernails against wood. It was coming from the door directly across from where I was hiding. Someone, or something, was scratching at the door from the inside, trying to get out.
The scratching grew more frantic, joined by a soft thumping sound, as if someone were pressing their whole body against the door. Then came the voice—a whisper so quiet I almost thought I was imagining it:
"Please... let me out... please..."
It was Mrs. Kowalski's voice.
I stared at the door in horror. The scratching continued, desperate and rhythmic, and I could see the wood around the handle beginning to splinter. Whatever was behind that door wanted out very, very badly.
"Mrs. Kowalski?" I whispered.
The scratching stopped immediately. The silence stretched out for what felt like hours.
Then came the voice again, but something was wrong with it. It was still Mrs. Kowalski's voice, but the words came too fast, all run together: "Yesyesyes please help me I've been here so long please the door won't open please help me please please please—"
I approached the door slowly, my hand reaching for the handle. The voice continued its desperate stream of words, but as I got closer, I realized that it was just the same few phrases repeated over and over, like a recording stuck on loop.
My hand touched the handle, and the voice stopped abruptly. For a moment, there was complete silence. Then came a sound that made me jerk my hand back as if the metal had burned me—the sound of laughter. Soft, low, and nothing like Mrs. Kowalski's laugh. It was the sound of something that had learned to imitate human laughter but didn't quite understand what it was supposed to mean.
I backed away from the door, but the laughter followed me. It seemed to come from behind every door I passed, a chorus of voices that weren't quite right, all laughing at some joke I wasn't part of.
I ran again, but this time I wasn't just running from exhaustion or fear—I was running from the growing certainty that I was trapped in something that was pretending to be my building, my home, my world. And somewhere in this maze of identical corridors and doors, something was pretending to be the people I knew.
The laughter faded behind me, but I could still hear those wrong footsteps, always just around the next corner, always just out of sight. And ahead of me, the hallway stretched on into darkness, filled with doors that might lead anywhere, or nowhere, or to places that human minds weren't meant to comprehend.
I kept running because stopping would mean accepting that this was real, that I was lost in a place that couldn't exist, surrounded by things that wore familiar voices like masks. And somewhere in the back of my mind, a small voice whispered the thing I didn't want to acknowledge:
I wasn't just lost. I was being herded.
The corridor began to slope downward, so gradually that I didn't notice at first. The walls pressed closer together, and the ceiling lowered until I had to duck slightly to avoid the flickering fluorescent tubes. The air grew thicker, harder to breathe, and tasted of dust and something else—something sweet and rotten that made my stomach turn.
Behind me, the sounds were getting closer. Not just footsteps now, but other noises—scratching, tapping, a soft rustling like fabric brushing against walls. And voices, dozens of them, whispering words I couldn't quite make out in languages I didn't recognize.
The slope steepened, and I realized I was descending into some lower level of this impossible building. The doors here were different—older, made of darker wood, with handles that looked like they hadn't been turned in years. The nameplates weren't just blank; they were corroded, green with age, and some had symbols carved into them instead of spaces for names.
I tried one of the doors. The handle turned easily, too easily, as if it had been oiled recently. Inside was another hallway, identical to the one I'd just left, stretching away into darkness. I could see doors lining both sides, each one exactly the same as all the others.
A maze. I was in a maze of hallways and doors, and each door led to more hallways and more doors. And somewhere in this labyrinth, things that sounded like people I knew were calling my name.
I closed the door and kept moving down the main corridor. The sounds behind me were definitely getting closer now. I could hear breathing that didn't sound quite human—too fast, too shallow, as if whatever was making it had too many lungs or not enough.
The corridor ended abruptly at a heavy metal door marked with a symbol I didn't recognize—something that looked like a combination of letters and numbers that hurt to look at directly. The door had no handle, just a flat metal surface with small holes arranged in a pattern.
I pressed my palm against the door, and it swung open with a grinding sound that seemed to come from very far away.
Beyond the door was a stairwell, but not like any stairwell I'd ever seen. The stairs descended in a spiral that seemed to go down forever, disappearing into blackness below. The walls were made of concrete, but they glistened with moisture that reflected the sparse lighting in strange ways.
I had no choice but to go down. Behind me, the sounds were almost at the metal door, and I could hear something testing the handle, scratching at the surface with what sounded like claws.
I started down the spiral stairs, gripping the metal railing tightly. My footsteps echoed in the enclosed space, but the echoes seemed to come from both above and below, as if there were other people on the stairs that I couldn't see.
As I descended, I began to notice things carved into the concrete walls—not words or symbols, but patterns that seemed to move when I wasn't looking directly at them. And there were stains on the walls, dark patches that could have been water damage or could have been something else entirely.
The stairs went down and down, far deeper than any building should extend. I counted levels as I passed them—each one marked by a small doorway that led into darkness—but I lost track after twenty. My legs ached and my lungs burned, but I didn't dare stop. Above me, I could hear the metal door slamming open and the sound of pursuit beginning again.
Finally, after what felt like hours, I reached the bottom of the stairwell. Another metal door, this one marked with a simple number: 0.
I pushed through the door and found myself in a vast space that defied all logic. The ceiling was so high it disappeared into shadows, and the walls stretched away into the distance like the boundaries of some underground city. The floor was covered with a thin layer of water that reflected the sparse fluorescent lighting, creating the illusion that I was walking on the surface of a dark lake.
And everywhere, as far as I could see, there were doors.
Thousands of them, maybe tens of thousands, arranged in neat rows like tombstones in a cemetery. Each door was identical to the ones I'd been seeing all day—dark wood, brass handle, blank nameplate. But here, they stood free-standing, not connected to any walls or rooms. Just doors, standing in the water, leading nowhere.
I walked among them, my footsteps splashing softly in the shallow water. Some of the doors were closed. Others stood slightly ajar, revealing nothing but darkness beyond. And a few were wide open, showing not rooms or hallways, but empty space—just the back of another door a few feet away.
It was then that I understood, with a clarity that cut through my fear like a blade, that I was no longer in my building. I wasn't even in my world. I was somewhere else, somewhere that wore the shape of familiar things but got all the details wrong. I was in a place that existed in the spaces between spaces, in the gaps that appeared when reality wasn't looking.
I was in the backrooms.
And I was not alone.
From somewhere among the endless rows of doors came the sound of my own voice, calling my name.
To be continued...
This is Chapter 1 of "The Silent Courtyard." The story will continue as our protagonist discovers more about their predicament and begins to navigate the various levels of the backrooms, each more surreal and dangerous than the last.

<h1>DEEPSEEK; THE ECHO CHAMBERS</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: The Silence That Screamed</h2>

The alarm clock blared its digital shriek, slicing through the remnants of a dream already dissolving like smoke. 7:00 AM. Wednesday. Mark groaned, slapping a hand onto the plastic beast, silencing it. Sunlight, weak and dusty, filtered through the gap in his cheap curtains. Same as always. He stretched, bones cracking in familiar protest, and swung his legs over the edge of the bed. The worn carpet felt reassuringly scratchy under his bare feet.

He padded to the window, yawning, expecting the usual morning symphony: the distant rumble of the 7:15 commuter bus braking at the corner, Mrs. Henderson’s shrill yell for her cat, Mr. Peterson hacking up a lung while starting his ancient pickup. He pulled the curtain aside.

Silence.

Not peaceful quiet. Not early-morning hush.

Absolute, suffocating silence.

The street below was empty. Completely empty. No cars parked along the curb. No cars moving. The bus stop was deserted. No Mrs. Henderson. No Mr. Peterson. No cat. The sidewalks were vacant stretches of concrete baking in the already-warm sun. No joggers. No dog-walkers. No shuffling figures heading to work.

Mark blinked. Rubbed his eyes. Blinked again. The emptiness didn’t change. It pressed against the glass, a physical weight. He craned his neck, looking left down Maple Street towards the bakery. Closed sign? No, not closed. Just… empty. The big glass window revealed dark shadows inside, no movement. He looked right, towards the small park. The swings hung perfectly still. No kids. No pigeons pecking at crumbs. Nothing.

A cold finger traced its way down his spine. Okay, weird. Really weird. Maybe a gas leak? Some city-wide emergency drill he’d forgotten? But there’d be sirens. Police tape. Something.

He dressed quickly, the rustle of his jeans and t-shirt unnaturally loud in the bedroom. The silence in the apartment felt thicker now, heavier. He walked down the short hallway, the floorboards groaning under his weight – a sound he usually barely registered, now it echoed like a gunshot. He paused by the front door, listening. Nothing from the apartment above. Nothing from Mrs. Gable’s place next door. Usually, by now, he’d hear her morning news blaring through the thin walls.

He unlocked his door and stepped out into the hallway. Dim fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a sound he’d always hated, now weirdly comforting. It was *a* sound. He knocked sharply on Mrs. Gable’s door. "Mrs. Gable? You in there? Hello?" His voice sounded thin, swallowed by the silence. He knocked harder, the sound sharp and final. No response. No shuffling feet. No muffled TV.

He tried the doorknob. Locked. He moved to the apartment opposite, belonging to the quiet student, Ben. Same result. Knocking, calling, silence. He went downstairs to the main foyer. The mail slots were empty. The small table where the super sometimes left notices was bare. The front door was unlocked. He pushed it open.

The street hit him. Not with noise, but with its utter lack of it. The air was still, warm, and carried a faint, unfamiliar scent – like stale carpet and ozone, undercut with something vaguely sweet and rotten. It was the smell of abandonment cranked to an impossible level. He stepped onto the sidewalk, the concrete warm under his sneakers. He looked up and down Maple Street. Nothing moved. No birds in the sky. No insects buzzing. The traffic lights cycled pointlessly – green, yellow, red – over empty asphalt.

"HELLO?" Mark yelled, his voice startlingly loud, bouncing off the brick facades of the buildings. "ANYBODY? IS ANYONE HERE?"

The echoes mocked him, repeating his desperate call until they faded into the oppressive stillness. He walked towards the bakery. The door wasn’t locked. He pushed it open, a little bell jingling with obscene cheerfulness. Inside, it was dim. Pastries sat untouched under glass domes, already looking stale. Cups sat on tables, half-full of cold coffee. A newspaper lay open on the counter, dated yesterday. But no baker. No customers. No one.

Panic, cold and slick, began to rise in his chest. This wasn't a drill. This wasn't right. He ran out, slamming the bakery door behind him. He sprinted down the street, past the closed hardware store, the shuttered bookstore, the darkened windows of the small Thai restaurant he loved. Every door he tried was either locked or opened onto emptiness. Houses stood silent, curtains drawn or windows dark. Cars sat parked, keys sometimes still in the ignition, but utterly lifeless.

He found a police cruiser parked haphazardly near the park, driver's door hanging open. Inside, the radio hissed static, a constant, empty whisper. No officer. No sign of struggle. Just… absence.

Hours bled away as Mark searched. He shouted until his throat was raw. He peered into windows, seeing only furniture frozen in time. He tried car horns, setting off blaring alarms that cut through the silence like screams before dying away, leaving the vacuum even more profound. He found a phone booth – the old, clunky kind – and fumbled for change. Dial tone. Good. He dialed 911. It rang. And rang. And rang. No answer. He tried his mother’s number. His best friend’s. His own apartment. Ringing into the void.

Exhaustion, deeper than physical tiredness, settled over him like a lead blanket. He slumped onto a bench in the deserted park, head in his hands. The sun beat down, warm and uncaring. The silence wasn’t just the absence of sound anymore; it was a presence. It watched him. It pressed in on him. It whispered things he couldn’t quite hear in the rustle of dead leaves skittering across the path. You are alone. Utterly, completely alone. Forever.

He thought about his apartment. The familiar, slightly messy space. His bed. His books. It felt like the only anchor left in this terrifying sea of nothing. He needed to get back. Maybe… maybe he’d wake up. Maybe this was just a hyper-realistic nightmare. He’d go back to bed, and when he woke again, Mrs. Henderson would be yelling for her damn cat.

He trudged back down Maple Street, the journey feeling longer now, weighted with dread. His building looked the same. Solid. Real. He climbed the stairs, each step heavy. He reached his door, Apartment 3B. He fumbled for his keys, hands shaking. He unlocked it, pushed it open, stepped inside, and slammed it shut behind him, leaning against it, breathing hard.

The familiar scent of his apartment – old books, coffee grounds, faint dust – was a small comfort. He walked to the sink, filled a glass with water, and drank deeply. He needed to think. Plan. Ration food. Find a working car. Get out of the city. See if the emptiness extended…

He walked towards his bedroom window, needing to see the street again, to confirm the impossible stillness. He pulled back the curtain.

His breath hitched.

The street outside was not Maple Street.

It was a long, straight corridor, impossibly vast, stretching into a sickly yellow-tinted distance. The walls were a damp, stained yellow wallpaper, peeling in places. The floor was a coarse, damp-looking brown carpet. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, some flickering erratically, casting long, distorted shadows. The air shimmered slightly, thick with the smell of mildew, wet carpet, and that underlying sweet-rotten stench, now overwhelming. It was a place of utter, sterile wrongness. It looked like the forgotten back hallway of an endless, decaying office building, lit by the worst fluorescent bulbs ever made.

Panic exploded in Mark’s chest, pure and primal. He stumbled back from the window, knocking over a lamp. It crashed to the floor, the sound swallowed instantly by the buzzing silence of this new place. He whirled around. His apartment looked the same. His bed, his desk, his posters. But the window… the window was a lie. A portal to this… this thing.

He ran back to the front door, yanked it open. The familiar apartment hallway was gone. Instead, more of the endless yellow corridor stretched in both directions, identical, monotonous, humming with the fluorescent buzz. The door to Mrs. Gable’s apartment was still there, but it looked subtly wrong – the wood grain seemed to shift if he stared too long, the brass doorknob unnaturally dull.

He slammed his own door shut again, locking it, throwing the deadbolt. He pressed his back against the wood, heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. Cold sweat prickled his scalp. The buzzing lights in the apartment seemed louder now, harsher. The familiar shapes of his furniture felt alien, potentially threatening. Was the shadow in the corner deeper than before? Did the bookcase just… twitch?

It looks like home, a terrifyingly calm voice whispered in his mind, cutting through the panic. But it’s not. It’s a trap. A skin over something else. And outside… outside is worse.

He slid down the door to the floor, hugging his knees. The silence of the empty city had been horrifying. But this… this buzzing, yellow wrongness pressing in from the window and the door… this was a different kind of terror. It wasn't just emptiness. It was a place. A place that didn't want him. A place that felt actively hungry.

He remembered snippets of internet lore, whispered stories of impossible spaces, of getting lost in the architecture of reality itself. A word surfaced, cold and sharp: The Backrooms.

Was that it? Had he… clipped through? Fallen out of the world and into the drywall? Into some nightmarish, non-place that mimicked reality only to mock it?

He looked at the window again. The yellow corridor stretched on, infinite and indifferent. The buzzing lights flickered. And far, far down the corridor, something pale and vaguely human-shaped seemed to shuffle around a distant corner, disappearing from sight before he could be sure it was ever there.

A choked sob escaped Mark’s throat. The search for other people was over. Now, the only thing that mattered was survival. Surviving the silence. Surviving the buzzing. Surviving the things that might be lurking in the endless, yellow halls of this place that wore his city’s face like a cheap mask.

He was no longer just lost. He was inside the nightmare. And the front door was no longer an exit. It was just another entrance into the suffocating, infinite wrongness.

The buzzing filled his skull. The smell of wet carpet filled his lungs. The silence of the city was gone, replaced by the low, electronic hum of a tomb the size of a universe. Mark buried his face in his hands, the familiar fabric of his jeans offering no comfort. The apartment walls felt thin as paper. Outside the window, the yellow hell waited.

The Echo Chambers had claimed him.

(Chapter 1 End)






<h1>GROX; Chapter 1: The Silence Outside</h1>

I woke up with a jolt, my heart hammering in my chest. The room was dim, the curtains half-open, letting in a weak, gray light that stretched long shadows across the floor. I couldn’t remember falling asleep. Last night was a blur—just a vague memory of sitting on the couch, the TV flickering in the background. But now I was in bed, still in my clothes, my shoes kicked off at the foot of the mattress. My body ached, like I’d been lying still for too long, and a heavy unease settled over me as I sat up.

I shuffled to the window and yanked the curtains wide. What I saw stopped me cold. The street below my apartment was empty. No people, no movement, nothing. Usually, it was alive—cars honking, kids shouting, neighbors arguing through thin walls. But now, it was dead silent. The buildings across the way loomed like tired giants, their gray and beige facades streaked with grime and peeling paint. They looked older than they should, worn down in a way I didn’t remember. A thick fog clung to everything, smudging the edges of the world, making it feel small and suffocating.

I pressed my face closer to the glass, squinting. The cars were still there—red sedans, a white van, that ugly yellow taxi I always saw parked crookedly—but they sat abandoned, tires flat or windows cracked. The street glistened wet, like it had just rained, and small puddles reflected the dull sky. Down in the corner, near the edge of my view, was the playground. A slide, a swing set, a basketball hoop with a faded orange rim. It was empty too, the swings hanging limp, the sand beneath them untouched. I could’ve sworn I saw a figure there for a second—a blurry shape in light clothes, standing still in the fog—but when I blinked, it was gone.

A chill crawled up my spine. Something was wrong. I rubbed my eyes, hard, thinking maybe I was still half-asleep, caught in some weird dream. But the scene stayed the same. No birds, no wind, just that thick, pressing silence.

I grabbed my phone from the nightstand. The screen was black. I jammed the power button, but it wouldn’t turn on. Dead. Frowning, I stumbled to the kitchen and snatched the landline off the wall. I held it to my ear—nothing. No dial tone, no static, just more silence. My stomach twisted into a knot.

I had to get outside, see what was happening. Maybe there’d been an evacuation, some emergency I’d slept through. I pulled on my shoes, grabbed my jacket, and headed for the door. My hand hovered over the knob, hesitation creeping in. The quiet was too much—it felt alive, like it was watching me. I shook it off and stepped into the hallway.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, flickering yellow. The air smelled stale, musty, like no one had been here in weeks. I walked to my neighbor’s door—Mrs. Jenkins, the old lady who always smelled like lavender and complained about my music. I knocked. No answer. I knocked harder, the sound bouncing off the walls. Still nothing.

I tried the knob. It turned, and the door swung open with a slow creak. “Mrs. Jenkins? You there?” My voice sounded small, swallowed up by the emptiness. The apartment was a mirror of mine, same layout, but the furniture was coated in dust. A coffee mug sat on the table, half-full, like someone had left it mid-sip. I backed out, my skin prickling. This wasn’t right. Just yesterday, she’d waved at me in the hall.

I checked another door, then another. All the same—empty, abandoned, silent. My chest tightened as I hurried down the stairs, the walls looking off somehow, paint peeling in strange patterns, stains I didn’t recognize. When I reached the ground floor, I shoved the heavy front door open and stepped into the fog.

It was thicker out here, cold and damp against my face. The street stretched out, deserted, the cars sitting like relics. I walked toward the playground, my shoes scuffing the wet pavement. The swings creaked faintly, swaying just a little, though there was no breeze. I stopped by the slide, my breath catching. For a split second, I thought I saw a shadow dart across it—quick, gone when I turned. “Hello?” I called, my voice shaky. “Anyone out here?”

Nothing answered.

I couldn’t stay still. I had to figure this out. I decided to head toward the city center—maybe someone was there, maybe I’d find answers. I knew the route by heart: left at Elm Street, straight past the deli, a few more blocks to the square. But as I walked, the streets changed. The buildings grew taller, darker, their windows blank and staring. The fog thickened, swallowing the path ahead. I turned where Elm should’ve been, but the sign read “Unknown Ave.” in cracked, faded letters.

My head spun. I’d taken a wrong turn, that was all. I retraced my steps, but every corner looked the same—gray, wet, empty. After what felt like hours, my apartment building loomed up again, right in front of me. I froze. I’d been walking away from it. How was I back here?

I stared at the playground. It was on the wrong side now, to the right instead of the left. My pulse raced. This wasn’t my city. It was something else, something twisted.

I stumbled back inside, my mind screaming for answers. My apartment was different too—the couch was against the wrong wall, the TV gone, the shelves empty. In my bedroom, the bed was a mess, sheets tangled like someone else had slept there. On the nightstand was a photo I didn’t know: me, smiling with strangers in front of a building that looked like mine but wasn’t.

My hands shook as I dropped it. This wasn’t a dream—I pinched myself, felt the sting. It was real, and it was wrong. I had to get out, find a way to see past this fog. The roof. Maybe from up there, I could spot something.

I climbed the stairs to the roof access, shoved the rusty door open, and stepped into the wind. The fog parted just enough to show the city sprawling out—endless, impossible. Buildings twisted into each other, streets bending at weird angles, and that damn playground popped up again and again, like a glitch. This wasn’t a city anymore. It was a trap.

Then I saw it—a faint glow in the distance, cutting through the mist. A tall shape, maybe a tower. If I could get there, I might understand this place. But the streets were a maze. I scanned the roof and spotted a fire escape ladder—not leading up, but down into a swirling haze that didn’t match the street below.

My gut told me it was a risk, but staying wasn’t an option. I gripped the ladder and climbed down, the air growing colder, the fog closing in. When my feet hit solid ground, the city was gone.

I was in a huge, dim space—a warehouse, maybe. Concrete stretched out forever, walls rough with rust and rebar. Lights flickered overhead, weak and yellow, barely cutting through the mist. The ladder was gone behind me, just a blank wall. My throat tightened, but I forced myself to move.

The place was a mess of hallways and dead ends, doors that went nowhere. Hours passed, maybe—I couldn’t tell. Then I heard it: a low growl, deep and close. My blood turned to ice. Something was here with me.

I ran, feet pounding the concrete, the growl chasing me through the fog. I ducked into an alcove, pressing myself against the wall. The sound stopped, then shifted—heavy, dragging steps. A shape lurched past: tall, twisted, skin hanging loose, eyes like black holes. It sniffed the air, then shuffled off.

I waited, trembling, then crept out. On a wall nearby, I found scribbles: “Beware the hounds. Stay quiet.” Another said, “Find the elevator. Blue light.” And then: “Level 1.”

Level 1? The word clicked—backrooms. Those creepy stories I’d laughed off online. Endless mazes, monsters, no way out. Was this real? I didn’t have time to doubt it. I searched for that blue light, dodging red-handled doors like the notes warned, until I found it—a glow behind some crates, an elevator with a button labeled “Hub.”

I hit it, stepped inside, and the doors shut. It dropped, and when they opened, I was in a round room with a map on a pedestal: “The Hub.” Doors lined the walls, labeled with numbers—Level 0, Level 2, up to 10. A notebook sat there too, full of warnings: “Level 5 has Howlers.” “Level 7 might be an exit.”

I picked Level 4—“Abandoned Office. Safer.” The door led to a beige corridor, all dull carpet and dusty desks. I wandered, the sameness gnawing at me, until I heard tapping. A voice called, “Who’s there?”

A woman stepped out—Sarah, she said, mid-twenties, scared but tough, holding a pipe. She’d been here days, surviving off vending machines, dodging things that weren’t human. “Level 7 might get us out,” she told me. “But we’ll need to go through worse to get there.”

We teamed up, grabbed supplies, and found a staircase to Level 5—a fancy hotel, all chandeliers and rot. A scream split the air—a Howler. We hid, barely breathing as it rattled our door, then left. At a desk, we found a map pointing to Level 6, but a ragged man we met swore there was a shortcut to Level 7 behind a painting.

We found it—a door in a gallery wall—and climbed to Level 7: an ocean, a beach, a lighthouse. The radio crackled with a voice from Level 9, promising an exit at “The End.” But a monster rose from the water, tentacles thrashing. We rowed to Level 8’s caves, then walked to Level 9—a suburbia trap. Fake survivors grabbed us, locked us in a basement.

We escaped through a window, running to a forest, out of breath but alive. “We can’t trust anyone,” Sarah said. I nodded. The backrooms were hell, but there was a logic to them. If we could crack it, we might get out.

For now, we’d keep moving.


<h1>GEMINI; </h1>
The insistent drumming against the frosted pane of the window had been a subconscious rhythm throughout the night, a counterpoint to the distant hum of the city that usually lulled me to sleep. But when I finally pried my eyelids open, the rhythm was gone. The only sound was the dull throb behind my temples, a hangover from a dream I couldn't quite recall, something about an empty street and a car alarm that never stopped.

My apartment, usually a haven of familiar clutter, felt strangely muted. The light filtering through the window was a flat, uninspired grey, devoid of the usual early morning golden tint. I stretched, my back cracking with a satisfying pop, and swung my legs over the side of the bed. The silence was the first thing that truly registered. Not just the absence of the drumming, but the complete, utter lack of the city's usual morning symphony. No distant sirens, no rumble of buses, no chirping of birds. Nothing.

A prickle of unease, cold and sharp, traced its way up my spine. This wasn't right. I pushed myself up and stumbled towards the window, pulling back the heavy curtain.

The scene outside was a perfect, unsettling replica of what should have been. The familiar apartment buildings, their faded facades echoing decades of lives lived within their walls, stood sentinel across the courtyard. The asphalt parking lot, usually a chaotic mosaic of vehicles, was indeed filled with cars, just as it always was. Their muted colors, reds, blues, silvers, were exactly where they should be. The patch of scraggly trees, their leaves still a vibrant green from the spring, cast their usual shadows. Even the small, dilapidated playground with its rusty swings and chipped slide sat undisturbed. It was all there.

Except for the people.

My breath hitched. My eyes darted from window to window of the opposing buildings. Usually, at this hour, I'd see the faint flicker of lights as early risers stirred, the occasional silhouette of someone moving through a room. But there was nothing. Every window was a dark, blank stare. The parked cars, normally a constant stream of drivers pulling in or out, were frozen in place, like exhibits in a museum of everyday life. No one was getting in, no one was getting out. No doors were opening, no engines were turning over.

A knot of dread tightened in my stomach. This wasn't a dream. My hand, trembling slightly, reached for the window latch. It was cold to the touch. I fumbled with it, my fingers suddenly clumsy, and pushed the window open. A gust of stale, surprisingly still air wafted in. Even the wind, a constant companion in this city, was absent. The silence, now that the window was open, was even more profound, more absolute. It pressed in, a heavy blanket smothering all sound.

I leaned out, my neck craning. Down below, on the concrete path that snaked through the courtyard, there was no one. No old women with their grocery bags, no teenagers loitering, no children on their way to school. The playground was empty, the swings motionless. It was a perfectly preserved diorama of a city street, waiting for its inhabitants to appear. But they never did.

"Hello?" My voice, a ragged whisper, sounded alien in the oppressive quiet. It seemed to shrivel and die in the vastness of the empty air. I tried again, louder this time. "Is anyone there?"

Only the echo of my own desperate plea answered me.

My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drum against the silence. This was impossible. This was a nightmare. I pinched myself, hard, on the arm. The sharp sting of pain confirmed my reality. I wasn't dreaming.

I stumbled back from the window, my mind racing. What could have happened? A sudden evacuation? A silent apocalypse? But there were no signs of anything. No overturned cars, no broken windows, no scattered debris. Just… nothing.

A sudden, overwhelming urge to find someone, anyone, consumed me. I had to know. I had to understand.

Without bothering to change out of my sweatpants and t-shirt, I grabbed my keys from the hook by the door. My hand shook as I turned the lock. The click of the tumblers seemed deafening in the silence of my apartment. I pulled the door open, bracing myself for… I don't know what. Perhaps a rush of panicked people, a desperate explanation.

The hallway was just as empty as the outside. The usual murmur of televisions, the faint aroma of cooking, the distant sound of a child crying – all gone. The doors to my neighbors' apartments, usually slightly ajar or occasionally opening as someone left for work, were all closed tight. Unyielding. Impenetrable.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm the frantic beating of my heart. This was crazy. This was absolutely, unequivocally insane.

I started down the hallway, my bare feet padding softly on the worn linoleum. Each step felt heavy, deliberate, as if I were moving through thick water. I paused outside my next-door neighbor's door, Mrs. Petrova's. She was an elderly woman, always up early, puttering in her kitchen, the smell of her strong coffee often wafting under my door. I knocked, tentatively at first, then harder.

"Mrs. Petrova?" My voice was thin, reedy. "Are you there?"

Silence. Only the faint, almost imperceptible hum of the building's unseen machinery answered me.

I knocked again, harder, my fist a desperate battering ram against the solid wood. "Mrs. Petrova! Please, open the door!"

Nothing. Not even a creak.

I moved on to the next door, then the next. My knuckles grew raw, my voice hoarse, as I pounded on every single door on my floor. Each one met me with the same unyielding, terrifying silence. No light under the cracks, no sound from within, no response whatsoever. It was as if the apartments were empty tombs, preserving the illusion of life without the slightest hint of a pulse.

A cold dread began to seep into my bones, a chilling realization that was far more terrifying than any sudden catastrophe. This wasn't an evacuation. This was something else entirely.

I reached the stairwell, its concrete steps stretching down into the dim light of the floors below. Usually, there would be the faint echo of footsteps, the occasional distant clang of the elevator. Now, it was just the heavy silence, broken only by my own ragged breathing.

I started down, my pace quickening with each floor. My heart was a frantic drum against my ribs, each beat echoing the growing panic in my chest. First floor. Second floor. Third floor. I knocked on every door, pounded on every surface, my voice growing hoarser with each unanswered plea.

"Hello? Is anyone here? Please!"

My voice was a desperate shriek now, bouncing off the cold, hard walls of the stairwell, a useless cry into an abyss of nothingness. My mind began to splinter. This wasn't real. It couldn't be. This was a twisted, elaborate prank. But who would do this? And why?

I reached the ground floor, my legs burning, my lungs aching. The main entrance, a heavy glass door, stood before me. Through it, I could see the deserted street, the empty pavement, the motionless cars. The sky was still that flat, uninspired grey. It was as if the world had simply stopped, frozen in time, with me as the sole, terrified witness.

I pushed the door open, stepping out onto the street. The air, still and unmoving, felt heavy, almost suffocating. The silence out here was even more profound, more absolute, than inside the building. The city, once a vibrant tapestry of sounds and movement, was now a still-life, a perfectly rendered painting devoid of life.

I walked, aimlessly at first, then with increasing desperation. I passed shops, their windows displaying their wares to an absent audience. Cafes, their tables and chairs neatly arranged, seemed to be waiting for customers who would never arrive. Cars, parked along the curbs, gathered dust. The only sound was the scuff of my own bare feet on the pavement, a lonely, defiant rhythm in a world that had gone utterly mute.

I tried to call out, my voice a ragged whisper. "Is there anyone?"

My throat was raw, my vocal cords protesting the strain. The silence swallowed my words whole.

I wandered for hours, or what felt like hours. The sun never seemed to move. The sky remained that unchanging, oppressive grey. My legs ached, my head throbbed, and a terrifying, bone-deep weariness settled over me. The initial fear began to morph into something deeper, more insidious. A profound sense of isolation, a terrifying realization of my utter solitude.

The city, once a comforting presence, now felt like a vast, empty prison. Every familiar landmark, every street corner, every building, became a mocking reminder of the lives that were no longer there, the people who had simply vanished. It was as if the world had played a cruel trick, pulling back a curtain to reveal a stage set, meticulously crafted, but utterly devoid of actors.

Panic, cold and sharp, flared again. I had to find someone. I had to.

I began to run, my breath coming in ragged gasps. I ran down familiar streets, past familiar parks, through familiar plazas. I pounded on every door, every gate, every shopfront I encountered. My voice, now a raw croak, pleaded for a response, any response.

"Open up! Please! Anyone!"

But there was never an answer. Only the chilling echo of my own despair.

As the indefinite hours wore on, the initial shock began to give way to a creeping, insidious dread. This wasn't just an empty city. It was a perfectly preserved replica of my city, but wrong. Subtly, terrifyingly wrong. The air was always still. The light never changed. And the silence… the silence was a living, breathing entity, pressing in on me, whispering of my utter solitude.

I slumped against a cold, brick wall, my legs giving out beneath me. Tears, hot and stinging, streamed down my face. A desperate, primal sob tore from my throat. I was alone. Completely, utterly, terrifyingly alone. The world had emptied itself of humanity, leaving me as the sole, forgotten survivor.

A cold certainty began to settle in my mind, a chilling whisper that cut through the fog of my panic. This wasn't the world I knew. This wasn't just an empty city. This was something else. Something… unnatural. The complete lack of any sign of life, the static nature of the light, the oppressive silence – it all pointed to one terrifying conclusion.

I was trapped. And the image outside my window, the perfectly familiar, yet utterly desolate scene, was not just a view of my city. It was the first chilling glimpse of my new reality. A reality that was nothing like the one I had known. A reality where every familiar comfort had been stripped away, leaving only the chilling, unyielding vastness of an empty, desolate world. The city outside my window, so perfectly replicated, was nothing more than a stage, and I was the only, unwitting performer, condemned to walk its empty streets, forever searching for a presence that would never appear. And deep down, a terrifying suspicion began to form, a whisper of a possibility that I desperately tried to push away. A suspicion that this familiar, yet alien, place was not truly my home at all.

<h2>GPT; Chapter 1: The Silence Outside</h2>

Once upon a time, I woke up and noticed something strange. The sound was gone. Not gone like a quiet morning after a snowstorm, but gone like the world had forgotten how to make noise.

I sat up in my bed, confused, listening. Nothing. No birds. No cars. No footsteps. Just the faint hum of my refrigerator, buzzing like a dying fly. I thought maybe it was early. Really early. Maybe everyone was still asleep. But when I pulled the curtains aside and looked out the window, something tightened in my chest.

No one.

The courtyard between the apartment buildings was completely empty. Not a single person walking to their car, no kids heading to school, no old men dragging their dogs out for a morning piss. The usual line of cars was there, parked just like always. But there was no movement. Nothing.

I stared at the scene longer than I should have. The buildings stood tall and quiet, staring back at me like they were holding their breath. My breath fogged the glass a little. That’s how I knew I was still alive.

I got dressed slowly, like I was underwater. Jeans. T-shirt. Hoodie. Socks. Sneakers. I didn’t really know why I was dressing at all. I just had to do something, anything. I opened my front door and stepped into the stairwell. The echo of the door closing behind me sounded too loud, like it didn’t belong. The hallway lights flickered once.

I knocked on my neighbor’s door. Mrs. Glavatskaya. She always baked something that made the whole hallway smell like cinnamon. Nothing. I knocked again, harder. I even tried the handle. Locked.

I went to the next door. Then the next. Then the next. I yelled. I banged. I kicked. No answer.

Eventually, I stopped knocking. It was useless. There was no one home. No one in the whole damn building. I went downstairs. My footsteps felt sharp and wrong, bouncing back at me like a threat.

Outside, it felt colder than it should have. I walked past the playground where the kids usually played. The swing creaked slightly, like it had moved on its own. I looked up at the sky. Gray. Covered in clouds, but not stormy. Just still.

I kept walking.

I walked around the block, down the main street. Stores were closed. Windows were dark. A dog sat on a stoop, watching me. It didn’t bark. Just stared. I didn’t see a single soul. No one.

The city was gone.

But the buildings were still here.

I returned to my apartment sometime later. I don’t know how long I was gone. I sat down on my bed and stared at the wall for a while. Tried the TV. Static. Tried the radio. Static. Internet? The pages loaded, but there was nothing new. Everything had stopped the day before.

That night, I didn’t sleep.

The next morning, the buildings had changed.

At first, I thought I was dreaming. Or maybe going crazy. But when I looked out the window, the view wasn’t the same. The courtyard was wider. The buildings were taller. The colors were off, like someone had painted them from memory.

I ran down the stairs and out the front door. My apartment building was still there, but the street was wrong. It stretched on too far, like the city had been stretched like rubber. Some corners were sharper. The trees looked dead, but green at the same time.

I walked until my legs hurt. Until the sky started turning a shade of orange I’d never seen before. I kept going, thinking maybe I’d find someone, something.

But I didn’t.

And when I turned around to go back home, the building wasn’t there.

That’s when I knew.

This wasn’t my city anymore.

It wasn’t any city.

This was something else.

A space between.

A trap.

A backroom of reality.

And I was stuck in it.
